## Intuition of this paper
To solve challenging registration problems by maximizing the number of corresponding semantic regions - such as windows, doors or balconies.

In this work, 

1. they approximated semantic regions by ellipsoids, and leverage their convexity to formulate the correspondence search efeectively 
as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the number of matched regions 
(which is solved by <strong>globally optimal in a Branch-and-Bound fashion </strong>).

2. they derived suitable <strong>linear matrix inequality constraints</strong>


## 1. Definitions

#### 1.1 Semantic Region Correspondences

#### 1.2 Consensus Maximization
